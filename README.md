DJSON Viewer and Formatter
==============

Chrome extension for exploring and navigating Bitmovin APIs in a browser tab.
Also quite useful for printing and formatting any JSON and JSONP nicely directly.

Based on the quite excellent [dardesantis DJSON-Viewer](https://github.com/dardesantis/DJSON-Viewer), itself based off the formatter from: [callumlocke json-formatter](https://github.com/callumlocke/json-formatter)
Makes heavy use of [dchester JSONPath](https://github.com/dchester/jsonpath)

Features
--------
* Beautify the Bitmovin API JSON responses
* Decorates them with various links to navigate to related objects
* Optionally calls links to extract information about related objects
* All decorations and mappings flexibly configured through a JSON file

The following are the original features from [dardesantis DJSON-Viewer](https://github.com/dardesantis/DJSON-Viewer):
* Format JSON and JSONP input or responses
* Minify or Beautify JSON
* Theme support
* Syntax highlighting
* Collapsible trees, with indent guides
* Recursive collapsible elements
* Clickable URLs
* Toggle between raw and parsed JSON
* Works on any valid JSON page – URL doesn't matter
* Works on local files too (if you enable this in `chrome://extensions`)
* You can inspect the JSON by typing `djson` in the console
* Counts items and properties in a collection
* Show JSON path of the elements on hover and copy it with the context menu
* Option to start with JSON collapsed (always or if the file is big)
* Recognize nested JSON strings in properties value

A background worker is used to prevent the UI freezing when processing very long JSON pages.

Installation
------------

**Option 1** – install it from source:

* clone/download this repo,
* open Chrome and go to `chrome://chrome/extensions/`,
* enable "Developer mode",
* click "Load unpacked extension",
* select the `extension` folder in this repo.

**Option 2** - Nope, not at this stage... ;)

Pro Tip
--------
* Hold down control (or cmd on Mac) while collapsing a tree if you want to collapse all its siblings too.
* Hold down shift while collapsing a tree if you want to collapse also all his children

FAQ
---
* Go to the extension options (gears in the top right corner) to disable XHR calls if the formatting is too slow for large JSON payloads
